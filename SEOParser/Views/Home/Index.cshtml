<p>This is a tool that you can use to check how well your website is optimised for google search. Just supply a keyword 
that is relevant to your website and the domain name of your website. The tool will scrape the top 100 results and determines
which ones directly link to that domain name. <b>Brute force mode</b> makes 100 requests and only takes the top result so 
as to ensure that "related" results (as marked by Google) are not considered. Without brute force mode, only 9-10 request 
will be made. (Recommended as accuracy will not differ significantly and related links might also be useful to consider)</p>
